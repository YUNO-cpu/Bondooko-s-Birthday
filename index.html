          <p>Even though it hasn't been long, I'm truly glad I got to meet you.</p>

          <p>Talking to you has honestly become one of my favorite parts of my day lately.</p>

          <p>Sometimes I catch myself thinking about what it would be like to spend unplanned day with you in person.</p>

        <div class="letter-page">
          <p>Just sitting somewhere, feeling truly alive, talking random things and laughing like we usually do.</p>
          <br>
          <p>It's a small thought, yet it stays in my mind longer than I expect.</p>

        <div class="letter-page">
          <p>I wasn’t even sure if I should make this, but I still wanted to do something for you today.</p>
          <br>
          <p>So I made this little thing, just for you. I hope it makes you smile, even just a little :)</p>
