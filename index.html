      Happy Birthday 🎂<br><br>

I know we haven’t known each other for that long,
but I’m really glad that I met you.<br><br>

Talking to you has honestly become one of my favorite parts of my day lately.
Sometimes I don’t even realize how much I was waiting for your reply
until it’s already there.<br><br>

Sometimes I catch myself thinking about what it would be like
to celebrate this day with you in person one day.
Not in a big or dramatic way,
just sitting somewhere, feeling truly alive,
talking about random things and laughing like we usually do.<br><br>

It’s kind of a small thought,
but it stays in my mind longer than I expect.<br><br>


I wasn’t even sure if I should make this,
but I still wanted to do something for you today.<br><br>
So I made this small thing, just for you.<br><br>

I hope it makes you smile, even a little :)
