        Happy Birthday 🎂<br><br>
        I know we haven’t known each other for that long,
            but I’m really glad that I met you.<br><br>
        
         Talking to you has honestly become one of my favorite parts of my day lately.
         I don’t even realize how much I was waiting for your reply
          until it’s already there.

        Sometimes I catch myself thinking about what it would be like
            to celebrate this day with you in person one day.
            Not in a big or dramatic way,
            just sitting somewhere, sharing a drink,
            talking about random things and laughing like we usually do.<br><br>

            It’s kind of a small thought,
            but it stays in my mind longer than I expect.

        I wasn’t even sure if I should make this,
            but I still wanted to do something for you today.
            So I made this small thing, just for you.<br><br>

            I hope it makes you smile, even a little :)
