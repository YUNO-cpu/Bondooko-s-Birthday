        <p>Happy Birthday, Bondooko<br><br>
        Even though it hasn't been long, 
        I'm truly glad I got to meet you.<br><br>
        Talking to you has honestly become
        one of my favorite parts of my day lately.</p>

      <div class="letter-page">
        <p>Sometimes I catch myself thinking
        about what it would be like
        to spend unplanned day with you in person.<br><br>
        Just sitting somewhere, feeling truly alive,
        talking random things and laughing like we usually do.<br><br>
        It's a small thought, yet it stays in my mind longer than I expect.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="letter-page">
        <p>I wasn’t even sure if I should make this,
        but I still wanted to do something for you today.<br><br>
        So I made this little thing, just for you.
        I hope it makes you smile, even just a little :)</p>
